<h1>Trees and Mindsets</h1>  
    <p>
        Derek Muller and Carol Dweck present their theories on education in very different manners. Muller argues that it is possible to learn more when we first discover how we were wrong, while Dweck presents a case for the importance of a growth mindset. However, their two theories revolve around the same central idea of being open to error and having more success when we first discover the ways in which we fail. Dweck argues that a growth mindset, where we confront our deficiencies and capitalize on our mistakes is critically superior to a fixed mindset, where failure is unacceptable and deficiencies must be hidden at all costs. This is the same idea for the basis of Mullerâ€™s theory because he places emphasis on understanding how our perceptions were wrong in order to more fully learn what is right. It is also interesting the emphasis that both educators placed on STEM concepts, as Dweck cited studies which tracked math scores and Muller focuses his research on teaching physics concepts. This similarity could be considered a demonstration of the fact that a growth mindset which accepts shortcomings is especially important in STEM areas, such as computer science.

<h1>In Addition to Mindsets...</h1>
    <p>
    I think that experiential learning is another crucial element to education. By practicing what you learn, a much deeper understanding becomes possible. This is something that I have personally found to be true in several aspects of my life. I the classroom, I have found that doing the homework problems in classes like math and physics allowed me to more fully understand the material and have a greater rate of success when the exam rolled around. Hopefully the same will ring true in this class. The place where I have most heard about experiential learning, however, is through a summer leadership program where I was required to practice what I had been taught by serving as a day camp counselor for at least one week. Without these weeks of practice, I am most certain that I would not remember anything that I had learned. However, because I had practiced, I have experiences to match up with the theories and have furthered my understanding of how I can be an effective leader. Throughout the process of experiential learning, a growth mindset and an openess to learn from mistakes is also crucial.
